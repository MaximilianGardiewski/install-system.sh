You're correct that the URL for the Tomcat 8 repository does not provide a release file in the traditional sense used by package managers like `apt`. The Apache archive repository for Tomcat 8 is designed for direct download of the binaries, not as an `apt`-compatible repository.

### Alternative Approach: Manually Download and Install Tomcat 8

Since you cannot add it as a standard `apt` repository, you can manually download and install Tomcat 8 from the archive.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Download Tomcat 8
1. Navigate to the desired directory where you want to download Tomcat:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/
   ```

2. Download the latest version of Tomcat 8 from the Apache archive:
   ```bash
   wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.73/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.73.tar.gz
   ```

3. Extract the downloaded tar file:
   ```bash
   sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-8.5.73.tar.gz
   ```

4. Rename the extracted directory for easier access:
   ```bash
   sudo mv apache-tomcat-8.5.73 tomcat8
   ```

### Step 2: Set Permissions
Set appropriate permissions so that Tomcat can be run by a non-root user (typically, you would not want to run Tomcat as `root` for security reasons):
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/tomcat8
chmod +x /opt/tomcat8/bin/*.sh
```

### Step 3: Start Tomcat
To start Tomcat, run the startup script:
```bash
/opt/tomcat8/bin/startup.sh
```

You can access the Tomcat server by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser if it's running locally.

### Step 4: Create a Systemd Service for Tomcat 8 (Optional)
If you'd like to set up Tomcat as a service, you can create a systemd service file.

1. Create the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomcat8.service
   ```

2. Add the following content:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Apache Tomcat 8
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking

   User=your_user
   Group=your_user

   Environment="JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
   Environment="CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat8/temp/tomcat.pid"
   Environment="CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat8"
   Environment="CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat8"
   Environment="CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC"
   Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom"

   ExecStart=/opt/tomcat8/bin/startup.sh
   ExecStop=/opt/tomcat8/bin/shutdown.sh

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Reload systemd to register the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. Enable the service to start at boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable tomcat8
   ```

5. Start the Tomcat service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start tomcat8
   ```

6. You can check the status of the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status tomcat8
   ```

By following this approach, you'll have Tomcat 8 installed and running manually, without relying on a repository.
